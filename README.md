This is a simple interactive lab that lets you play around with the
Perceptron, a remarkably elegant neural network invented by
Frank Rosenblatt in 1958.

To run it, you'll need to [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
and run:

```
cargo run
```

Once the window opens, you can press `H` for help.
